\section{Is there just one Higgs boson?}



\section{What did each analysis do, and how do we combine two analyses?}

One analysis group studied the case where one intermediate new Higgs decayed into two bottom quarks, and the other into two tau leptons (written h -> aa -> 2b 2tau).
The second analysis group considered the case with two muons instead of two taus, i.e. h -> aa -> 2b 2 muons. 

Both analyses use bottom quarks in the final state: bottom quarks are heavy enough to decay into jets (showers of particles in a cone), which are also challenging to reconstruct
and difficult to distinguish from low-energy interactions which we are not interested in.

The analyses differ in the muons and taus in their final states, and these particles are extremely different: muons are stable in the detector and are fairly well-reconstructed. 
In comparison, the tau lepton is unstable and decays inside the detector. About 35\% of the time, a tau lepton decays into the lighter leptons (i.e. electrons and muons), and the remaining 65\% of the time, it decays into hadrons, 
which further decay. These possibilities complicate tau reconstruction and distinguishing them from background noise. 

In order to optimize sensitivity to new physics, the two groups independently developed very different strategies.

For instance, the h->aa->2b 2tau group trained a machine learning algorithm to identify signal-like events and reject background events. When applied to real data, the algorithm assigns a score from 0 to 1, 
based on how signal-like the data event is. We use this score to categorize real data based into signal regions (where we expect to see the most signal) and control regions (which we expect to see only background). 


In contrast, the h->aa->2b 2mu group distinguished signal-like events from background events by defining a physical variable based on the masses of the two b quarks and two muons, which tends to be very small for signal-like events,
and large for background events. The advantage of this approach is to utilize the excellent muon mass reconstruction provided by the CMS detector. 

Despite these two different approaches, the goal is the same: to reject as many background events as possible while maximising the potential number of signal events.
The final measurement is also the same: looking for an excess of events as a function of the total mass of the pseudoscalars. 

This allows us to combine our results, improving the experiment's overall sensitivity to the exotic Higgs decay, compared to if the two groups' results were only considered individually.
